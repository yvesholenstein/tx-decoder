# Samples TODO

Please add sample TON payloads here for verification and testing.

Suggested files:
- `nominator-deposit.boc.txt` — base64 BOC of a native pool deposit
- `nominator-withdraw.boc.txt` — base64 BOC of an unstake/withdraw request
- `tonstakers-deposit.boc.txt` — base64 BOC of a liquid staking deposit
- `tonstakers-redeem.boc.txt` — base64 BOC of a redeem request

For each sample, ideally also provide the expected hardware wallet (Ledger) hash that should be displayed during signing so we can validate parity.
